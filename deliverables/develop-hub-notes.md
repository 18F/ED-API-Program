### Editing a microsite


### Creating a new page

Once a microsite is live, creating a new page is as simple as creating a new file.  

* It's a best practice to create and use a `/pages/` folder to put these files so that they are contained in one place.  
* The file should be called _name-of-file.md_.  You could instead be an entire `HTML` file called _name-of-file.html_ but that is usually less convenient.  
* You will need to include certain metadata:

````
---
layout: default
title: API Basics
nav: basics
permalink: /basics/
---

````
