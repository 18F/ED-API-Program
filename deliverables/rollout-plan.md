### Pre-Rollout

* Identify a target dataset, if possible before it is released.  
* Review the dataset's structure to weigh its impact on the API design.  Consider modifying to 
improve the API's design.  
* Upload the dataset into the API engine.  
* Confirm that the new API is functioning.  
* Prepare API documentation.  
* Set up feedback engine.  
* Internally review API documentation and get feedback on the developer experience.  
* Ask external trusted testers to review and give feedback.  
* Perform an API Usability session.  
* Document the baseline traffic to the developer hub and for the APIs themselves.  
* Set up and test potential system monitoring.  
* Draft communications.  

### Roll-out 
* Coordinate the planned release of the API.  
* If possible, make the API documentation live and linked on the developer hub 1-2 days in advance.  
* Release any traditional communications such as a press release or blogpost.  
* Release further, developer-targeted communications such as: 
  * Email the US Government API and Open-Data listserves. 
  * Tweet and post on Facebook direct appeals to developers who may be interested in the API.  
  * Post on Hacker News. 
  * Email existing API key owners.  
* In all developer communications, expressly mention the feedback engine and ask for input.  
* Engage on traditional stakeholder forums.  
* Monitor API usage.  

### Post Rollout
* Make a point to be particularly responsive to developer feedback and questions.  
* Over the first week, continue a rolling set of social media posts.  
* Ensure the API's ease of discoverability.  
* One month in, consider publishing an update on how the API has been used so far, e.g. number of API keys and hits and highlight examples of its use.
