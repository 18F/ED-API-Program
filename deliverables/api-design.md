_Under Construction_ 

The goal of this exercise is to map out ideas of what a dream Dept. of Education API would look like.  Specifically, what data and functionality would be avialable in it and how it would be designed.  Please feel free to suggest edits to the below.  

The below should strive to encompass all of the information and workflows of the Department.  Much of the thinking will focus on user stories for third parties that interact with the agency, whether businesses, schools, non-profits, or individuals, but we should also recognize that the agency itself is a consumer of its own information and workflows and that the best API is one that is used just as much by its creators as by third parties.
